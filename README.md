# Vaud-Bike-sharing-Forecasting
This is an academic Forecasting project. The purpose of this project is to forecast the total number of available bikes for every 10 minutes at 8 bike-sharing stations in Morges, including Medtronic, Moulin, Gracieuse, Préverenges, Sablon, Casino, Dufour, and Temple, on Wednesday, May 25th, 2022. The collected data is from a large Swiss bike-sharing company from March 4th to May 24th over 10 minutes intervals. In this project, several methods, such as Naïve, ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonal), and ARIMA, from Forecasting I are applied. In addition, we also apply ARIMA with the Fourier terms to capture complex seasonality.
